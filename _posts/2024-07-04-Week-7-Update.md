### What did I do last week?

- Completed the next class in the learning path: React Creating and hosting a full stack site
- Set up repo and directory structure for project app

### What do you plan to do this week?

- Complete the next 2 classes in the learning path (they're both fairly short)
  - React Hooks
  - React Accessibility
- At least start on the next class, Building Modern Projects with React
- Complete Life-long learning assignment

### Are there any impediments in your way?

- The learning path is taking longer to get through than I'd planned.

### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

- I was still able to make progress on my project despite many other demands on my time but I'm behind where I want to be as far as starting development. I've been able to work ahead in my other classes though and should be able to use the holiday weekend to take some much needed down time. By taking this rest, I'll hopefully set myself up to successfully complete the work for the rest of this semester.
