### What did I do last week?

- Started on LinkedIn Learning React learning path.
- Early in the first class, was informed that I really needed to take a separate JavaScript-specific class first, so pivoted to that. Currently about halfway through (it's a 6-hour class).
- Completed my assigned peer reviews for classmates' projects.

### What do you plan to do this week?

- Complete JavaScript class.
- Work on personal website.

### Are there any impediments in your way?

Nowhere in the description for the React learning path did it mention needing to take any classes outside of it first, so learning that I not only needed to take another class, but one that's 6 hours long (basically 2 weeks of my time for this class) was a significant setback to some of my project plans. I will need to take a look at my project and see how I need to adjust to accommodate the extra learning time because just spending more time on the project isn't an option for me this semester.

### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

I've gotten the flow down for my other classes this semester and was able to stick to the time I'd set aside for doing my learning path for this one. It's a lot to balance at the moment and I need to figure out a better time for doing the personal website work. This week I put it after my other assignments and then ended up being too exhausted to work on something that wasn't an immediate need.
