### What did you do last week?

I thought about and researched possibilities for my semester project and worked on setting up my GitHub Pages site.

### What do you plan to do this week?

I followed the directions for setting up the GitHub Pages site but when I try to visit it, I get an error, so my first priority is to fix that. Once that's complete, I plan to finalize my project topic and sign up for/start any necessary training classes needed.

### Are there any impediments in your way?

I'm a little busier at work than I planned to be when I planned my courses for the summer. HR unexpectedly shifted the timeline for performance evaluations, so I need to not only complete my own but also complete them for the team that I supervise. I know from previous years that this process can be fairly mentally taxing.

### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

I realized that my current class workload is manageable, but I need to be more organized about tracking my weekly task list because I felt very scattered about making sure I'd completed everything. I've now set up a tool (basically a spreadsheet) with the to-do list for each class for each week until the end of the semester in one combined spot. I can now put the mental energy I was using to try to figure out what I still needed to do into doing the work instead.
