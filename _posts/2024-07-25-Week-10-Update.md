### What did I do last week?

- Completed the last 3 hours of the JavaScript class
- Cleaned up personal website to make it more functional and presentable
- Started working though React learning path

### What do you plan to do this week?

- Continue working through React learning path
- Start brainstorming about app design and features

### Are there any impediments in your way?

I'll be out of town this weekend so I have less time to complete assignments this week.

### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

Time management continues to be crutial. I need to break watching Linkedin Learning videos into smaller time periods because after a certain amount of time, I find my mind wandering and I end up having to rewind and rewatch. It would be more time efficient to just take a break and then come back when I'm ready to concentrate on the content again.
