### What did I do last week?

- Completed the React Hooks and React Accessibility and then decided to just push through all of Building Modern Projects with React
  -There are 2 more classes in the learning path, but I've decided not to take them - One is very in depth dive into Authentication that might be good to learn about at some point, but is far beyond the level I will need for this project. One of the other courses covered using Firebase Authentication and that seems sufficient for my needs for this project.Â  - The other covers server-side rendering, which again might be a great thing to learn about, but is beyond the scope needed for what I'd like to accomplish at this point
- Completed the Lifelong learning assignment

### What do you plan to do this week?

- Complete the Project Update assignment
- Finalize some page designs using moqups.com
- Get at least one feature coded (login or basic form)

### Are there any impediments in your way?

- Some of the classes were more helpful that others and have bookmarked particular videos, so I'm feeling pretty good about where I am currently. Biggest challenge I see currently is needing to remind myself to start small with the actual code and build on that rather than trying to do a whole bunch of things at the same time because they look fun/interesting.

### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

- Making the decision not to take the final 2 classes in the learning path because they're beyond the scope I need is a big step forward. I'm usually a completionist, but I also know that part of managing my time well is deciding to say no to tasks that aren't the best use of that time.
