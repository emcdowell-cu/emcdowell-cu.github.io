### What did I do last week?

- I ended up having even less time than I hoped for school work while I was gone so besides some additional work on solidifying the the database design and implementation, I did not make much progress on my project

### What do you plan to do this week?

- Get back to working on the input form
- Start on final report

### Are there any impediments in your way? 

- I came back from my trip sick with covid. I'm feeling extremely fatigued. I'm not sure how much work I'll be able to do this weekend. It's going to depend on my energy levels

### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

- I worked all semester to make this race trip possible and besides coming home sick, it was 100% worth it. If I have to cut a few more features from my plans, it's ok and I'll still have something I'm proud of.
