### What did I do last week?

- Got basic version of a login page coded
- Created a prioritized to do list for additional features and tried to assign a reasonable estimate for each item to try to determine if it is possible to implement it in the time remaining in the semester
- Completed the Project Update Report

### What do you plan to do this week?

- Continue working on implementing additional features
  - the next priority is working on the form for inputing data

### Are there any impediments in your way?

- Time management mostly. And a little bit of frustration. I have a race next weekend and I've been working all semester in all of my classes to get everything done so that I can go and compete without having to juggle school at the same time, but I don't know if that's going to end up working out.

### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

- I'm really glad to have moved on to a more active coding phase of my project. In retrospect, I wish I had organized the project in such a way that I took a class and implemented something from that each week rather than front loading the learning portion.
