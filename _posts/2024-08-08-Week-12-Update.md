### What did I do last week?

- Got the input form working. It doesn't have all the features I'd like it to yet, but you can input and save data
- Started working on final report

### What do you plan to do this week?

- finish final report
- tidy up a few things to get the project complete as far as this class is concerned

### Are there any impediments in your way?

- No, I'm mostly over my bout of covid and also mostly done with other classes

### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

- I think at this point, just need to keep doing what I've been doing and get to the finish line
