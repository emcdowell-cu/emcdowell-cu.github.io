### What did I do last week?

- Completed the first 2 classes in the React learning path
  - React.js Essential Training (2 hours)
  - React Building an Interface (1 hour 40 min)
- Started some very rough sketches of app layout

### What do you plan to do this week?

- Complete the next class in the learning path: React Creating and hosting a full stack site
- Continue working on feature list for project

### Are there any impediments in your way?

I am absolutely slammed at work right now. We had a connection to an offsite datacenter go down earlier this week and are currently waiting on parts to be flown in (for the 2nd day in a row) to fix the issue. My team has a critical deadline on Monday that relies on this particular connection and it can't be pushed back so the time I usually spend on school work over the weekend is probably going to need to go to my day job instead.

### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

I have found the process of watching LinkedIn videos in smaller blocks of time and then taking a short break before continuing rather than just trying to power through them much more effective to actually retaining information. I'm going to continue with that strategy.
