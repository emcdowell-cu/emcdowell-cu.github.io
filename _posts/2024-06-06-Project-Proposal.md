#### Vision Statement

For this project, I plan to learn Javascript and more specifically, the React library. I then plan to use this knowledge to build a simple workout tracking app (website). This project will help me learn practical skills since Javascript is widely used in things like web and mobile applications. I will also be able to demonstrate that I can apply that knowledge to design and create my own functional application.

#### Motivation

I chose to create a workout tracker as my application because in addition to my studies and my full time job, I’m also a competitive masters rower. I’ve won numerous medals at USRowing’s Masters National Championships and later this year I’ll compete at the Masters World Championships in Berlin. I spend most of my free time training to compete, and my training generally comprises of a mix of rowing and weight training. I currently track these activities in 2 separate places, as it seems most apps are kind of optimized for either aerobic exercise (e.g. Strava, or ErgData) or for Crossfit/lifting (e.g. SugarWOD, BTWB, Heavy). Ideally I’d like to create something that allows me to see the relevant information in a more unified fashion.

#### Specific and Measurable Goals

Complete the relevant portions of the Explore React.js DevelopmentLinkedin Learning Path:

<ul>
 <li>React.js Essential Training</li>
 <li>React.js: Building an Interface</li>
 <li>React: Creating and Hosting a Full-Stack Site</li>
 <li>React Hooks</li>
 <li>Building Modern Projects with React</li>
</ul>
Design simple website based on the knowledge gained in the classes including:
<ul>
<li>Mockup of site layout</li>
<li>Plan for data storage</li>
<li>Create a functional prototype of the website</li>
<li>Can log and view 1 weeks worth of workouts</li>
</ul>

#### Risks to Project Completion

<ul>
<li>Have never worked with JavaScript or React. The learning process could take much longer than anticipatedt</li>
<li>Time management. I have other classes and  many other commitments. 
</li>
<li>Scope creep. If I try to implement too many things, I may end up with something only partially complete 
</li>
</ul>

#### Risk Mitigation Strategy

<ul>
<li>Spend the first few weeks focusing on learning with the goal of having a solid foundation before coding. Hopefully this will mean that there is minimal backtracking once I’ve started implementation.</li>
<li>Briefly revisit plan for completed project after each class is complete to apply new knowledge incrementally.</li>
<li>Be flexible about which classes actually get completed- if I start one and after viewing the curriculum in more depth, it won’t be relevant to my application, spend that time elsewhere (either another class or on implementation)</li>
<li>Take a critical view of what really is an MVP vs what is a “nice to have” from a feature perspective. Complete the MVP before adding any additional features</li>
</ul>

#### Project Assessments

Have completed the listed classes (or documented that the planned class wasn’t relevant)
Have a git repository with a functional React Application
Application allows the user to enter and save information, and then view the information they have entered
