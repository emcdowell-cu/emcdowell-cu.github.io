Vision Statement

For this project, I plan to learn Javascript and more specifically, the React library. I then plan to use this knowledge to build a simple workout tracking app (website). This project will help me learn practical skills since Javascript is widely used in things like web and mobile applications. I will also be able to demonstrate that I can apply that knowledge to design and create my own functional application. 


Motivation

I chose to create a workout tracker as my application because in addition to my studies and my full time job, I’m also a competitive masters rower. I’ve won numerous medals at USRowing’s Masters National Championships and later this year I’ll compete at the Masters World Championships in Berlin. I spend most of my free time training to compete, and my training generally comprises of a mix of rowing and weight training. I currently track these activities in 2 separate places, as it seems most apps are kind of optimized for either aerobic exercise (e.g.  Strava, or ErgData) or for Crossfit/lifting (e.g. SugarWOD, BTWB, Heavy). Ideally I’d like to create something that allows me to see the relevant information in a more unified fashion.


Specific and Measurable Goals

Complete the relevant portions of the Explore React.js DevelopmentLinkedin Learning Path:
React.js Essential Training
React.js: Building an Interface
React: Creating and Hosting a Full-Stack Site
React Hooks
Building Modern Projects with React

Design simple website based on the knowledge gained in the classes including:
Mockup of site layout
Plan for data storage
Create a functional prototype of the website
Can log and view 1 weeks worth of workouts


Risks to Project Completion

Have never worked with JavaScript or React
Time management
Scope creep


Risk Mitigation Strategy

Focus the first few weeks focusing on learning
Briefly revisit plan for completed project after each class is complete to apply new knowledge incrementally.
Be flexible about which classes actually get completed- if I start one and after viewing the curriculum in more depth, it won’t be relevant to my application, spend that time elsewhere (either another class or on implementation)
Take a critical view of what really is an MVP vs what is a “nice to have” from a feature perspective. Complete the MVP before adding any additional features


Project Assessments 

Have completed the listed classes (or documented that the planned class wasn’t relevant)
Have a git repository with a functional React Application
Application allows the user to enter and save information, and then view the information they have entered
