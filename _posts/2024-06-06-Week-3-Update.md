### What did I do last week?

- Got my GitHub Pages site up and running using Jekyll. It needs more work to make it look better, but I at least got it to a place where I fulfill the portion of the project proposal that requires a link to the project portfolio.
- Created and turned in my project proposal.

### What do you plan to do this week?

- Complete the 3 project reviews I'm assigned.
- Start on the React training from LinkedIn Learning that I picked out for my project.
- Improve the look and feel of my personal website (get an actual landing page in place and implement at least a skeleton version of any other parts of the page I plan on having).

### Are there any impediments in your way?

I'm still very busy at work with my team's performance evaluation process (I have one of the larger teams in the company) and a lot of my energy is being taken up by that.

### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

I've set out a certain block of time for this class each week (really 2 separate blocks on different days) and given other commitments, I really need to stay inside of that time frame. I wasn't expecting to need to spend as much time as I did on the personal website, for example, so for now, I'll monitor whether I've set appropriate project goals for the time I have available and plan to adjust them in future weeks as needed.
